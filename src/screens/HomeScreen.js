      <h2>About MQI</h2>
      <h4>The Organization</h4>
      <p>Minhaj-ul-Quran International, a Pakistan-based international organization working to promote peace, tolerance,
      interfaith harmony and education, tackle extremism and terrorism, engage with young Muslims for religious moderation,
      promote women’s rights, development and empowerment, and provide social welfare and promotion of human rights.</p>
      <p>
        In order to promote and propagate true Islamic teachings and philosophy, revive Islamic sciences, and for the moral
        and spiritual uplift of Muslim Umma, dissatisfied with the existing religious institutions and organizations and their
        narrow-minded approach, Dr Qadri founded Minhaj-ul-Quran in 1980. Headquarters of MQI are situated in Lahore. Vigorously
        pursuing its well-defined objectives and spreading its comprehensive and all-encompassing sphere of activity, including
        welfare, education, promotion of love culture and spiritual uplift all over the world, it is probably one of the largest
        non-political, non-sectarian non-governmental organizations in the world. Since its establishment on 17th October 1980,
        it has rapidly grown and, within less than 30 years, its organizational network has expanded to more than 90 countries
        worldwide. Minhaj-ul-Quran is unmatchable for its rapid growth and no contemporary religious or political organization
        or movement has spread worldwide in such a short span of time.
      </p>
      <h4>Major Objectives</h4>
      <p>Elaborating the aims and objectives of MQI, the founding leader Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri stated:</p>
      <p>“The primary aim of the Minhaj-ul-Quran International is to bring about a comprehensive and multidimensional change
      in the society which at the same time ends the academic and ideological deadlock and revive, once again, the exterminated
      moral and spiritual values (of Islam), and also exalt the Muslim Umma to an admirable and respectful status among the comity
      of nations by a continuous struggle based on glorious foundation laid down by the Holy Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him)
      on the universal principals of Love, Peace and Knowledge.”</p>
      <p>Minhaj-ul-Quran is not a movement based on just imaginary and impracticable ideology and philosophy but, on the contrary,
      is based on a comprehensive and practicable ideology. Its leadership has not only introduced the ideology but also provided
      a detailed strategy to be practically put into practice. Moreover, it aims at reviving the true values and principles of Islam,
      eliminating the social, cultural, ideological, moral, spiritual, economical, legal and political decline of Muslim Umma in particular
      and the whole mankind in general. Love, peace, harmony, universal brotherhood, justice, equity and prosperity lie only in the revival
      of these values. With this well-defined goal fixed, the MQI has laid down four major objectives to achieve.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daʻwa and Propagation of True Islamic Teachings</li>
        <li>Reformation of the Moral and Spiritual Affairs of Umma</li>
        <li>Revival of Islamic Sciences</li>
        <li>Promotion and Renaissance of Islam</li>

      </ul>

      <h4>The Distinctive Characteristics</h4>
      <p>The MQI holds strong discrimination from its contemporary religious organizations and parties in several different ways.
      It is unique and different from every other organization by virtue of its constitution, program, establishment, span of work,
      field, work style, and over and above all, its objectives. It can be distinguished from other organizations on the following
      five basic discriminatory grounds:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>All-embracing and all-encompassing struggle</li>
        <li>Sincerity of faith and devotion, and spiritualism</li>
        <li>Piety</li>
        <li>Changing the society for good</li>
        <li>Universalism</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Stages of the Minhaj-ul-Quran Movement</h4>
      <p>The struggle of Minhaj-ul-Quran International has been classified into stages inevitable for its expansion and development:</p>

      <p>1. First stage of MQI struggle is ‘Propagation’ in which the ideology of MQI is introduced to the people through Daʻwa.
      The whole world is breathing heavily under the threats of terrorism and bloodshed. The idiosyncrasies of extremism, fanaticism and
      radicalism generate terrorism. Unfortunately, Islam is being presented as responsible for all terrorism around the world. MQI is
      taking practical measures to present to the world the true Islam through preaching inter-faith dialogue and harmony, striving for
      promoting culture of tolerance and moderation and promoting the cause of human rights, justice and equity at global level.
      MQI’s Daʻwa program encompasses all these aspects and gives a call for global peace, security, love and harmony among the communities

      <p> 2. In the second stage, ‘Organization’, all those who join the MQI and get ready to work for the MQI objectives are put into
      organizational structure. They become regular members and are tasked to discharge their Daʻwa responsibility according to the
      instructions laid down by the central leadership. The work at this stage is successfully carried out by setting up branches and
      centres on national, provincial, district, city and town levels in and outside the country.
        </p>
      <p>
        3. Third stage concentrates on ‘Education and Training’. All the members and workers known as Rufaqa’ attend training sessions
        and camps where love for peace and justice, human dignity and equity is spiritually injected into their souls to bring them inner
        peace. That in turn brings about outer peace in society at large, through their pious and superbly moral behaviour towards their
        fellow human beings, irrespective of colour, race or creed. These training programmes are centrally controlled under direct guidance
        from Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. The MQI leadership believes that it is hard training that guarantees achieving the
        calculated results. The training programmes emphasize inculcating spiritual values and higher morality equipping the workers with
        personalities that spread love and peace through their natural behavior and style. The education and training sessions are held
        according to the following schedule:
        <ol>
          <li>Daily sessions of remembrance of Allah at unit level.</li>
          <li>Weekly sessions of Salutation on the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him).</li>
          <li>Weekly educational assemblies at sector level.</li>
          <li>Monthly training camps at tehsil level.</li>
          <li>Quarterly training camps at district level.</li>
          <li>Bi-annual three-day retreat (itikaf) at divisional level.</li>
          <li>Annual ten-day retreat (itikaf) at central level</li>
          <li>Monthly Irfan-ul-Qur’an session</li>
          <li>Ten-forty-and-sixty day learning courses</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Forth stage ‘Implementation’ signifies the struggle for the practical realization of social, welfare, cultural, legal, educational,
        religious economic and political vision and ideology of MQI. In this stage, using all the training obtained, the members of MQI lead
        by example by taking an active part in the society to carry out social and moral reform. This struggle comprises two phases: formative
        phase and completion phase.
        <ol>
          <li>The formative phase comprises all those activities and practical steps and measures that are essential to mobilize the masses towards
        achieving the goal.</li>
          <li>The completion phase consists of measures to attain the results and put the plan into action.</li>
        </ol>


      </p>
      <p>
        5. Fifth stage ‘Reformation’ refers to consolidation of results achieved by MQI and transforming them into actual and permanent change
        thus achieving reformation and renewal of the systems. This reformation focuses its advancement in the following directions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ideological Reformation</li>
        <li>Religious Reformation.</li>
        <li>Educational Reformation.</li>
        <li>Moral and Spiritual Reformation</li>
        <li>Social and Cultural Reformation.</li>
        <li>Societal and Institutional Reformation.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>The MQI forums</h4>
      <p>Under the umbrella of his nascent organisation, Minhaj - ul - Quran, Shaykh - ul - Islam established the Jamia Islamia
      Minhaj - ul - Quran in Lahore on 18th September 1986, now known as College of Sharia and Islamic Sciences(COSIS), an institute
      of Islamic Studies which would provide scientific, modern and progressive subjects alongside traditional, classical Islamic sciences,
      a blueprint for the mass educational system that was to follow.Thousands of students have graduated from this institution by now,
      hundreds of which are scholars engaged all over the world in spreading Shaykh - ul - Islam’s message of peace and modern scientific
      vision of Islam under his advice and continuous guidance.Various other wings of Minhaj - ul - Quran were established, including
      Minhaj - ul - Quran Youth League(MYL) on 30th November, 1988, Mustafawi Students Movement(MSM) on 6th October, 1994, Pakistan Awami
      Lawyers Movement(PALM) on 20th February 1997, and crucially, the Minhaj - ul - Quran Women League(MWL), the first of its kind associated
      with any religious organisation in Pakistan on 5th January 1988, promoting the rights and interests of women in a strongly male - dominated
      society with full participation of the womenfolk.The Minhaj - ul - Quran Ulama Council is another most dynamic forum of MQI that liaise with
      the religious scholars and authorities for coordination and organizing various programmes in order to work for greater harmony and unity
      among different religious sects of the society.This forum has proved instrumental in bringing about inter - sect harmony and cohesion and
      diluting and removing tensions if any.</p>
      <p>
        In a country with a literacy rate of under 50 %, Dr Qadri considered education to be a priority and established the Minhaj University
        Lahore(MUL) chartered by the Government, to provide higher education that would be accessible to the poor also.A remarkable
        large - scale education project, the Minhaj Education Society(MES) then followed in the early 1990s, which established hundreds of
        educational centres throughout Pakistan, accessible to both low income families and females.In the field of social welfare and disaster
        and poverty relief, Shaykh - ul - Islam formed a new sister organisation in 1989, later to be known as the Minhaj Welfare Foundation(MWF),
        which has benefited victims of natural disasters such as the Tsunami affecting Indonesia; the Bam earthquake, Iran; the South Asian earthquake
     in Pakistan, as well as various developments and educational projects in Pakistan and other underprivileged countries.</p>
      <p>
        When the Minhaj - ul - Quran International started its operations across Pakistan for the revival of Islam, the Muslims living in the
        foreign countries in general and Pakistani expatriate community in particular got attracted due to its efforts for the establishment of
        peace and inter - faith harmony.The Da‘wa work of Minhaj - ul - Quran International was started long before its organizational and
        administrative network was established.In order to communicate its message effectively across the five continents of the world, the
        Directorate of Foreign Affairs(DFA) was established in 1985 for better coordination.It is the result of untiring efforts of this
        Directorate that this network has spread across 90 countries of the world.This Directorate is ever busy strengthening and consolidating
        this network in foreign lands.
        </p>
      <p>
        Farid - e - Millat Research Institute(FMRi), housing a huge reference library, a Research Hall, composing section and record room is a
        unique set - up that provides research assistance to Shaykh - ul - Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri in his multiple projects in
        progress simultaneously.This institute was established on 7th December, 1987. A team of twenty highly qualified and skilled research
        scholars work tirelessly on various projects under the most enlightening guidance of Shaykh - ul - Islam.
        </p>
      <p>
        The Minhaj - ul - Quran Press and Publications Department is tasked with the publication of books of Shaykh - ul - Islam and works in
        close collaboration with FMRi.It has so far published about 360 voluminous books of Shaykh - ul - Islam and sold hundreds of thousands number of copies of each book through its sale system in country and abroad.Its responsibilities also include timely printing of calendars, diaries, posters, portraits and other material of any kind related to printing.All the books of Minhaj Education Society are also produced by MQI Printing Press.It is a self - sufficient set - up equipped with modern printing machines, folding and stitching machines and plate - making facility along with binding machines ensuring high quality products.The department also has its art and graphics section manned with most skilled designers.They produce designs of titles of the books, posters of Minhaj - ul - Quran for various programmes, titles of journals, advertisements, calendars, diaries, broachers and invitation cards.

        forever and does not charge even a penny in the form of royalty.
        Minhaj - ul - Quran International is busy on strong footing in the spread of Islamic teachings and safeguarding the faith of youth.A vast
        network of computer systems has been put in place to interlink various offices and departments of the Central Secretariat of Minhaj - ul - Quran International.With a view to linking up various dispersed Islamic nationalities into one coherent whole and showing the true face of Islam, Minhaj Internet Bureau(MIB) has been established.The www.minhaj.org is the very first central website of Minhaj - ul - Quran International containing complete introduction of MQI, its organizational structure, branches and departments.News and information regarding various activities being performed at the Central Secretariat or inside or outside of Pakistan are regularly posted on this site.

        The Decision Making Phenomena
        The MQI’s decision making phenomena are interlaced in a most refined hierarchy of the decision making bodies representing all levels of
        the MQI organizations existing around the world.The Supreme Council is the Final Authority of MQI headed by the Chairman Supreme Council,

      <h4> Achievements</h4>
      <p>
        In less than three decades, the Minhaj - ul - Quran International has made tremendous achievements in various fields of work.Taking its
        work span, time span and geographical work span, the results achieved so far are dazzlingly astonishing.Detailed information in this
        regard requires volumes of written work.We can have only the synopsis of the MQI performance in terms of solid results it has produced
        under the most dynamic and galvanizing leadership of Shaykh - ul - Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri.</p>
      <p>

        retreat and instructed all participants of Itikaf and workers of MQI to serve the flood - stricken people.
        Shaykh - ul - Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri has, over the years, brought about a culture of love for the Beloved Messenger
        of Allah(blessings and peace be upon him).Pursuing this objective he promoted hymnody(sessions of chanting Na‘at, the poetic eulogies
        to glorify the Holy Prophet[blessings and peace be upon him]) and Sama‘ gatherings in the holy month of Rabi - ul - Awwal(the month
        when the Prophet Muhammad[blessings and peace be upon him]was born).One of the salient features of this culture is serving common man
        with Ziyafat - e - Milad(extended meals) within the first 12 days of Rabi - ul - Awwal.The celebration consists of daily gatherings
        at the MQI headquarters where recitations of the Qur’an take place along with the Na‘at sessions followed by food served to every
        participant.An open invitation is served to everybody rich or poor to attend the Ziyafat.When food is served everybody sits and eats
        together, breaking barriers of wealth and poverty, removing all inhibitions and uniting people under the supreme banner of mercy of
        the Prophet Muhammad(blessings and peace be upon him).
        The annual International Meelad Conference is held at Minar - e - Pakistan Lahore on the 12th night of Rabi - ul - Awwal and lasts till
        the early morning of 12th Rabi - ul - Awwal for the celebration of Milad - un - Nabi(blessings and peace be upon him).This event has
        become a regular feature for last two and a half decades.Hundreds of thousands of people from all around the world attend the gathering.
        Rejoicing on the occasion, all these participants are served with Ziafat, the grand extended food.The night commences with the recitation
        of the Holy Qur’an, followed by Na‘at chanting to glorify the Prophet Muhammad(blessings and peace be upon him).Then Shaykh - ul - Islam
        delivers a lecture, followed by invoking greetings and salutations upon the Beloved Messenger of Allah(blessings and peace be upon him).
        This is one of the largest gatherings of the Muslim Umma around the world telecast live on satellite channels and internet for the benefit
        of all the Muslims around the world.
        The most soothing feature of this culture of love for the Holy Prophet(blessings and peace be upon him) is invoking durood, blessings, and
        salutations, on the Messenger of Allah.For this purpose, Gosha - e - Durood has been set up at MQI central headquarters Lahore.More than
        thirty - one billion(31, 00, 00, 00, 000) times salutations have been invoked on the Holy Prophet(Allah bless him and give him peace) at
        this
        Gosha - e - Darood so far.Following the line, Durood circles have come up in thousands in streets of the towns where the salutations are
        invoked on the Messenger of Allah(Allah bless him and give him peace) and are deposited with the central directorate.
        Shaykh - ul - Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri has authored 1000 books out of which 430 books have been published.His works are being
        translated into different foreign languages as well such as English, Arabic, German, Danish, Korean, Norwegian etc.
        5000 lectures by Shaykh - ul - Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri have been delivered and are available on audio video cassettes and
        different CD formats.Over a 1500 lectures have been produced on CDs and DVDs and are available on all the Minhaj - ul - Quran sale centres
        around the world.His lectures sold so far run in millions.
        Fighting poverty in the country, Shaykh - ul - Islam formed a new sister organisation in 1989 for social welfare and disaster and poverty
        relief, later to be known as the Minhaj Welfare Foundation(MWF), which has benefited victims of natural disasters such as the Tsunami
        affecting Indonesia; the Bam earthquake, Iran; the South Asian earthquake in Pakistan, as well as various developments and educational
        projects in Pakistan and other underprivileged countries.Aid worth crores of rupees has been distributed so far among the victims.
        The construction of a huge four - storey orphanage known as Aaghosh to house 500 orphans has been erected at Township Lahore.Already
        commissioned, Aaghosh is functional providing children with the umbrella of love, care and education to foster them into useful and
        balanced citizens.
        A heavy - budgeted institution known as Bait - uz - Zahra, is under construction at Township Lahore.This will complete within next few
        years and provide residence as well as education for the needy and talented girls.
        Minhaj Welfare Foundation arranges scholarships for those poor and needy students who are otherwise very intelligent and competent but
        due to lack of resources cannot get education.Under Minhaj Welfare Foundation, Student Welfare Board was established for this purpose.
        Scholarships are given to poor and needy students for secondary and higher education.The students benefiting from this scheme are in
        thousands studying at Minhaj schools and colleges.Millions of rupees have been spent on thousands of students so far.A large number of
        donors are given direct access to the schools to monitor progress of their respective donees.
        Eid Gift and Ration Scheme was started by MWF to provide relief to the destitute.Under this scheme, ration, sweet and food stuff are
        distributed among the poor on the occasions of Eids including Meelad - un - Nabi(blessings and peace be upon him).Millions of rupees
        have also been distributed among the sufferers of drought in the province of Baluchistan.The plans for provision of ration on permanent
        basis were also launched incurring huge budget.
        The total number of Minhaj Free Clinics throughout the country is 110. The establishment of this network has cost Rs. 3, 30, 00, 000 and
        550 thousand people have, so far, benefitted from this.
        Minhaj Welfare Foundation established five hospitals in different cities of Pakistan to provide better health facilities to the helpless
        and the poor.
        There are around 6 million blind people in the world today.The number of blind people in Pakistan is also increasing.Keeping this situation
        in view, Minhaj Welfare Foundation(MWF) started holding free eye surgery camps in the backward and far - flung areas of Pakistan.According
        to the prevalent concept of eye - camp in Pakistan, it is getting oneself checked up by a doctor one day and getting a prescription of
        medicine.Whereas annual free surgery eye camps are held under the banner of Minhaj Welfare Foundation benefiting thousands of patients each
        year.
        Arrangement of collective marriages by the Minhaj Welfare Foundation has become a feather in its cap for last few years.Collective marriages
        are also arranged not only in Lahore but also in other cities of the country.The branches of Minhaj Welfare Foundation undertook this project
        with great zeal and determination.The marriages of 630 girls have been arranged by Minhaj Welfare Foundation.These marriages cost rupees 9,
        45, 00, 000.The cooperation of local wealthy individuals extended to the Minhaj Welfare Foundation is a sign of trust in the organization.
        More than half of Pakistani population is deprived of clean drinking water today.Unclean water is available for drinking at most of the places
        giving birth to fatal diseases.Given this growing need of clean drinking water, Minhaj Welfare Foundation has installed 1500 water pumps
        across the country costing Rs. 7 million.The water pump installation campaign has covered numerous districts in all the four provinces of
        the country.
        The MWF has arranged Free Legal Assistance for the exploited / abused women.This is to rehabilitate the women sent to prison for failing to
        pay the fines / penalties or for other reasons and provide them Free Legal Assistance.The objective is also to provide them legal cover at
        police stations for safe and fair proceedings of their cases; develop a powerful, effective program to expose police atrocities and restrict
        injustice at police stations.In addition, women in Dar - ul - Amaan(House of Safety / Protection), Orphanage or Mental Hospitals are provided
        legal aid.The MWF works for creating awareness about the significance of Legal Assistance through seminars and presentations and struggles
        to
        remove social discrimination and ensure restoration of women’s social status.
        The MQI has launched sewing machine scheme as well to enable the poor women earn their living through sewing clothes.It is a very flourishing
        job within the Pakistani industry.A considerable number of people earn their living through this skill.Therefore, MWF launched a Sewing
        Machine Scheme to provide the destitute women with the machines.It facilitates them earn a respectable living and meet their basic domestic
        needs.
        But great achievement is the change that has taken place in peoples’ hearts and minds towards promotion of peace and harmony in the society.
        The MQI has considerably reduced sectarianism due to its dynamic struggle launched for this purpose.Inter - faith dialogue too has brought
        people of two faiths closer.The MQI has definitely achieved a degree of moderation, tolerance and promotion of human dignity and restoration
        of human rights and women rights through its Da‘wa, Training and organizing programmes in progress in country and abroad.This is heartening
        to see that people have started understanding the message of MQI and very bright prospects can be visualized in near future.
        Peace for Humanity Conference: It was on September 24, 2011, you saw Dr Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri in Wembley Arena, where some 12000 people
        had gathered to attend peace for humanity conference.The conference launched a campaign to get one million people to sign an online declaration
        of peace by 2012. According to BBC: “Normally it’s pop stars who attract the big crowds at Wembley Arena.Today it is the renowned Islamic scholar
        Dr Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri.You can even see posters of him on the buses travelling through the streets near the stadium.But his message is a
        serious one.He preaches that there are no conditions under which extremism and the violence it endorses can be excused.It’s a message that has
        found a big audience here at Wembley but one which has ironically made him the subject of death threats from those who don’t believe in
        peace.” The audience heard the pre - recorded messages of support from, amongst others, Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister
        Nick Clegg, opposition leader Ed Miliband, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki - Moon and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams.And
        there were prayers for peace from representatives from a number of different religions including the Bishop of Barking, the Rt Rev David
        Hawkins, Jewish rabbis and representatives from the Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh faiths.The declaration of peace included a call for democracy
        and good governance in the Muslim world, respect for human rights, and alleviation of poverty throughout the world.
        UN grants ‘Special Consultative Status’ to Minhaj - ul - Quran International: Recognizing the efforts and achievement of MQI in the field
        of education, social welfare and humanitarian development the United Nations Economic and Social Council(ECOSOC) has formally granted the
        ‘Special Consultative Status’ to Minhaj - ul - Quran International.UN ECOSOC consultative status allows NGOs to attend UN conferences and
        meetings, submit written statements and reports, make oral interventions, and host panels in UN buildings.Minhaj - ul - Quran International
        was recommended by the Committee on NGOs at its 2011 regular session and formally recognized during the UN Annual session.This award of special status at UN speaks of the global stature Dr Tahir - ul - Qadri has been bestowed upon for his love for humanity and his exalted services he has rendered to the interfaith cohesion and inter - communal integration at international level.
        Anti - corruption Long March: On 23 December, 2012 we witnessed the signature “save the state, not politics” campaign of
        Dr Tahir - ul - Qadri launched while addressing an ocean of people gathered at Minar - e - Pakistan Lahore. : “We reject the corrupt
        electoral system of Pakistan.” He elaborated his message and put forth his 7 - point demand during Long March, in the sea of people
        surging into the sit -in at D - Chowk Islamabad, asking the government to step down and step up the process towards real democracy under
        articles 62, 63 and 217 of the constitution of Pakistan, reconstituting the ECP and putting a neutral caretaker government in place.However,
        in Pakistan, politics means continuing with the corrupt electoral system.The venom of corruption has eaten deep into the vitals of its
        institutions—the ECP, the parliament, the constitutional amendments, the political parties and the governance.Under the curse of corruption,
        the corrupt elements in power quite duplicitously employed the ruse of an agreement—the Islamabad Long March Declaration(ILMD) —signed by
        the PM of Pakistan and all the leading politicians.Later, the corrupt, most brazenly and blatantly, backed out of ILMD.The custodians of
        the corrupt system—the corridors of power—dubbed Dr Qadri coming after years from abroad, was up to derailing the democracy—a conspiracy
        against the system.The people of Pakistan and those endeavouring for a change have once again been duped and hoodwinked.Those who saw a
        hidden hand behind the historic long march fell prey to what Dr Tahir - ul - Qadri called the corrupt system of electioneering to vote
        the corrupt to power.That is what Dr Qadri forewarned them at the beat of the drum, risking his life and the lives of the poor millions
        who glued to him during the hazardous and chill - bitten Long March.Yet the most strikingly peaceful and disciplined Long March at the
        D - Chowk and Dr Qadri’s waking - the - dead stance have stamped the veracity of his riling struggle.Contrary to the corrupt rulers and
        the custodians of the corrupt system, the people of Pakistan felt convinced, believed him and joined him in the historic millions Long
        March, on 14 January 2013. Those who contested the rigged elections are dressing their wounds they sustained through the bamboozled
        polling.The unfortunate victims of the corrupt electoral system regret today that they mistook Dr Qadri’s message and failed to
        follow him at the ripe time.Today everybody is calling him right and are stretching them up for a mega change based on the signature
        “save the state, not politics” campaign of Dr Tahir - ul - Qadri that he has ineradicably engraved on the national psyche through a
        socio - political commotion and the intellectual regurgitation of perceiving the abysmal ground reality.He accomplished a
        socio - political renaissance in the country—the decades’ task—performed only in four extremely cold days—14 to 17 January
        2013—of the freezing two months.Dr Tahir - ul - Qadri has enormously succeeded in awakening the masses to the butchery going for
        the jugular and sucking their blood, and has blown into them the spirit to rise and snatch their rights from the democratic monarchs.
        He has given a call for morphing millions into billions to wreak hurricanes and wreck the corrupt system with gales of street power.
        Minhaj Education City: It is over three decades now when Shaykh - ul - Islam Dr Muhammad Tahir - ul - Qadri founded the
        Minhaj - ul - Quran International(MQI) in 1981 and developed an MQI education complex in the Township of the metropolitan city,
        Lahore.Over the decades, the MQI has risen in many dimensions—many new buildings for Minhaj University, College of Sharia & Islamic
        Sciences, Minhaj College for Women, Jame al - Minhaj, Tahfeez - ul - Quran Institute, Aghosh Orphan House, Suffah Hall and
        Gosha - e - Durood were constructed, forums like Minhaj Education Society, Minhaj Welfare Foundation, Minhaj Youth League,
        Mustafavi Students Movement, Minhaj Ullama Council and Minhaj Women League were formed and more than two dozen directorates
        like Foreign Affairs, Dawah, Training, Research, Minhaj Production, Minhaj Publications, Minhaj Marketing, Sales Center,
        Minhaj Printing Press, IT Bureau and Minhaj TV were established.These huge establishments have used the secretariat facility
        and the bastion at Township to its capacity, and are now spilling over the precincts.The dynamic leadership of MQI has ambitious
        plans to keep pace with the fast moving modern life, maintain its effectiveness in the field, in Pakistan and the world over. The
        extending requirements for religious, educational and welfare projects of MQI need much more area for expansion and development. Therefore,
        Shaykh - ul - Islam has decided to acquire a 120 - acre piece of land in the peripheries of Lahore to cater imminent needs of the coming
        decades.This piece of land will host a great seat of learning called Minhaj Education City.It is a colossal plan seeking a prodigious
        architectural set up to translate it into reality that is now being examined and finalized.It has voluminous details to sketch a
        comprehensive introduction to the gigantic project.Only some of the salient features of Minhaj Education City have been described
        here to bring forth an image of the visualized future.</p>
